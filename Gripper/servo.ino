/*************************************************** 
  This is an example for our Adafruit 16-channel PWM & Servo driver
  Servo test - this will drive 8 servos, one after the other on the
  first 8 pins of the PCA9685

  Pick one up today in the adafruit shop!
  ------> http://www.adafruit.com/products/815
  
  These drivers use I2C to communicate, 2 pins are required to  
  interface.

   * oscilloscope in setting the int.osc frequency for the I2C PCA9685 chip.
   * 1) Attach the oscilloscope to one of the PWM signal pins and ground on
   *    the I2C PCA9685 chip you are setting the value for.

   *    expected value (50Hz for most ESCs)

   * affects the calculations for the PWM update frequency. 
   * Failure to correctly set the int.osc value will cause unexpected PWM results
